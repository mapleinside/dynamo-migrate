# Node Dynamo Migrate

> Node.js migration tools for AWS DynamoDB

> ‚ùå Sorry, but this library is no longer maintained. Please find an alternative.

## Configuration 

At first, you need to setup the environment variables:

* `DYNAMO_PREFIX`: database table prefix.
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

Then, you can override those environment variables:

* `DYNAMO_MIGRATIONS_TABLENAME`: the table name which will save done migrations.
* `DYNAMO_MIGRATIONS_FOLDER`: local directory where migration files are stored.
* `DYNAMO_ENDPOINT`
* `AWS_REGION`: your datacenter region.

It's strongly suggested to add the following scripts to your `package.json`: 

```json
"scripts": {
  "migrate": "node-dynamo-migrate"
}
```

## Commands

### Create

```bash
yarn migration -- create "create country table"
```

```bash
yarn migration -- up
```

Migrate up all new migrations since the last executed migration.

```bash
yarn migration -- up 002-add-country
```

### Down

```bash
yarn migration -- down 002-add-country
```

Migrate dowm the given migration.

### List

```bash
yarn migration -- list
```

List all the migrations on the remote server and when they have been run.
